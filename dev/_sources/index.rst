Zonopy Robots - Extensions to Zonopy for Robotics
=================================================

Zonopy-robots extends the Zonopy library to include functionality for robotics.
This includes kinematics, dynamics, and trajectory planning for robotic systems.
At the current moment, focus is on serial-link manipulators, but there are plans to support other types of robots.
This project is still early in development, so much of the API is subject to change.
